Score-based MRI Reconstruction Comparison
==========================================

Configuration:
- Mask: equispaced_fraction
- Acceleration: 4×
- Center fraction: 0.08
- Diffusion steps (N): 600
- Corrector steps (m): 1
- Checkpoint: checkpoint_50.pth

Test Set: 5 FastMRI knee multi-coil samples

Results
=======

SENSE (Fast):
- PSNR: 24.4 ± 4.6 dB
- MSE: 9.80e-03 ± 8.37e-03
- Time: 464.5 ± 10.3 seconds (~7.7 min)
- Evaluations: ~2,000 (combined image)

SSOS (High Quality):
- PSNR: 27.6 ± 1.5 dB
- MSE: 2.49e-03 ± 9.00e-04
- Time: 5831.6 ± 2.5 seconds (~97 min)
- Evaluations: ~30,000 (15 coils × 2,000 steps)

Performance
===========

Speed: SENSE is 12.5× faster than SSOS
Quality: SSOS is 3.2 dB better PSNR

Recommendation
==============

Use SENSE for:
- Large batch processing
- Time-constrained scenarios
- Good quality reconstructions

Use SSOS for:
- Publication-quality results
- Best PSNR requirements
- When time is not critical
